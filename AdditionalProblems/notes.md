**Shortest Subsequence**
**Counting Bits**
**Swap Game**

Bidirectional bfs. Rather than iterating through all four directions for all 
spots in the grid to compute swaps, precompute all possible swaps. Turns out
that there are only 12 such swaps. So for each grid position, can very quickly
find all next possible positions. Bfs runs from the starting grid and from the
target grid simultaneously to further speed things up.

While processing array, for each number n need to know the sum subs[i] for i < n
where subs[i] is the number of subsequences ending with the number i. From this 
want to increment the total count and subs[n] by sum(subs[i]: i < n) + 1, the +1
being for the subsequence of just [n]. The easiest way to do this is with a binary
indexed tree. However, since n can be up to 10^9, cannot use n to index the tree.
Instead, preprocess the input, storing all numbers in a map (this also eliminates
duplicates). Then iterate through the map, assigning the first number an index of 2,
the second number an index of 3, and so on. This compresses the values of n to a range
that can be represented in an array. (Starting at 2 just makes things easier by 
eliminating edge cases).

Build up the original stick backwards from the fragments. Greedily combine the two

cheap, as possible
